# Edunet_Project

The main purpose of this project is to create a centralized and comprehensive blood management 
system that addresses the inefficiencies in existing blood bank systems. The current systems are either 
manual or lack integration, making it hard to coordinate between donors, recipients, and blood bank 
personnel. This results in delays, wastage of blood units, and often missed opportunities to save lives. 
The proposed system aims to resolve these problems by digitizing every part of the process and bringing 
all users onto a unified digital platform. 


Donors will be able to register on the platform, view their eligibility based on the last donation date, and 
book appointments at nearby donation centers. Recipients, on the other hand, can request specific 
blood types and get real-time updates on availability and request status. Administrators will be 
responsible for validating users, monitoring requests, and ensuring blood stock levels are updated 
automatically after every donation or request fulfillment. The platform also includes features such as 
real-time notifications, location-based search, and role-based dashboards to personalize and streamline 
the user experience.
